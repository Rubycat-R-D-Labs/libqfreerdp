 * @brief a compositor to convert Qt to RDP screen updates
 * 
 * Qt is not optimized for refreshing a partial part of a
 * screen. This compositor minimizes the regions impacted
 * by changes.
 * 
 * For instance, on Qt 5.15 any change in a Qt Window triggers
 * a full update of the screen. This compositor will only update
 * the impacted region on a 64x64 square basis. That means if one
 * pixel the region impacted is 64x64 and not the entire screen.
